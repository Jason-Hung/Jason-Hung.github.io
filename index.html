										<p>
											From May to December of 2019, I was working at 7D Surgical Inc as part of my
											first and second co-op work terms. There, I joined the software team as a
											Software Developer Intern. In this report, I will be detailing my responsibilities,
											my learning goals, and what I've accomplished during my 8 months there.

										<p>
											7D Surgical is a medical device company specializing in image-guided surgery for spine and cranial navigation.
											Their system provides fast registration on the patient's anatomy, without the use of radiation.
											Traditional image-guided surgery systems may take up to 30 minutes to perform registration with the
											patient's anatomy, whereas the 7D Surgical System takes less than 20 seconds.

										<h2 class="major">My day-to-day</h2>
										<p>
											As a Software Developer, I was responsible for helping develop and maintain software
											that is deployed onto the system. I helped design and implement UI and create new core features
											for user-facing applications. I was also responsible for documenting software
											design specifications and requirements, as required by various regulatory bodies
											such as Health Canada and the FDA.
										</p>
										<p>
											I attended weekly meetings with the rest of the team to provide status updates
											and discuss scheduling of various projects. I also participated in code reviews
											to ensure quality of our software.

								<div class="inner">
									<div class="content">
										<h2 class="major">Workterm Focus</h2>
										<p>
											The focus for the first workterm was to gain an idea of what software development is
											like in the industry. Since I've never really had the chance to create software outside
											of school projects, I wanted to learn about standards and practices used in professional
											software development. I was also interested in seeing what the medical device industry
											is like with respect to software development, so I was also focused on learning how they
											operate.
										</p>

										<p>
											The focus of the second workterm was to continue to develop my skills in design and applying
											best practices when developing software. During the first workterm, I realised that I enjoy
											designing, and the critical thinking that comes with it. I decided that I wanted to focus on
											getting better at it by helping to design more UI and new features for the projects I'm assigned to.

									<h2 class="major">Learning Goals</h2>
									<p>
										As part of the University of Guelph's co-op program, I created 6 learning goals
										throughout the course of these two workterms.
									</p>
									<section class="features">
										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Understand the processes and practices that the company uses to develop their software</h3>
											<p>
												Before I joined 7D Surgical, I've only worked on small school projects. Due to the scale of the projects,
												following standards and processes wasn't as necessary to ensure completion. Because of this, I felt that
												I didn't really know how software development worked in the industry. So one of the goals for this workterm
												was to improve myself as a developer by learning about the processes and practices that 7D Surgical follows
												when developing software so that I could apply them to my future work.
											</p>
										</article>
										
										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Understand the development tools and technologies available to me</h3>
											<p>
												As I start to gain experience in the industry, I wanted to expand my knowledge of
												tools and technologies that are available to me to help develop software. This includes
												programming languages, source control tools, and project management tools. Throughout the
												workterm, I've gotten familiar with such tools that the company utilizes to develop their
												software, such as C#, .NET, Git, SourceTree, and Azure DevOps.
											</p>
											<p>
												I have been successful in progressing on this goal as a result, but there are many more tools
												out there, so this goal is not yet complete. (It might never be!) I plan to continue challenging
												myself to learn about the tools and technologies that are available, so that when there comes a time
												that I need to choose a tool to use, I will be able to make an appropriate decision.
											</p>
										</article>

										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Learn C#</h3>
											<p>
												C# was one of the languages listed in the job description. When I was brought onto the team, 
												I was completely new to the language, only having used it a couple times just to explore it.
												My goal was to become proficient in the language by the end of the workterm. I was able to
												successfully progress and achieve this goal, as Microsoft provides excellent documentation
												on C# and .NET. I'm confident I will be able to apply my knowledge of the language to future
												projects as appropriate.
											</p>

											<p>
												I have been successful in completing this goal, but there are still things to learn about the language
												and the .NET framework. I hope to continue working on my proficiency in this language through future
												projects.
											</p>
										</article>

										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Learn more about software architecture</h3>
											<p>
												As I discovered my interest for design in my first workterm, I wanted to explore it for my
												second workterm. Along with UI design, I also chose to explore software design and architecture.
												I was interested in how certain decisions are made when building software and why they are made.
												For example, I learned the MVVM design pattern when working on front-end features. Since the topic
												was new to me, my mentor suggested I do some self-study and look up what it's about on Google.
											</p>

											<p>
												I feel that I haven't progressed on this goal as much as I would have liked, so I will continue exploring
												topics in this area as they come up in future courses and work.
											</p>
										</article>
										
										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Improve my UI/UX design skills</h3>
											<p>
												Since I started to get more tasks assigned to me that involved designing
												and refining UI, I found that I enjoyed the critical thinking that was
												required. As I continued working on these skills, I noticed that I was beginning
												to identify elements of the UI that might need improvement without having to ask
												my mentor for feedback on my prototypes.
											</p>

											<p>
												I have been successful in progressing on this goal but I recognize that I am not
												an expert yet, and there is still room for improvement and learning. I hope to
												continue working on this goal in future workterms.
											</p>
										</article>

										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Improve my skills in applying best practices to write consistent, clear, and maintainable software</h3>
											<p>
												For the first two years of my degree, I felt that the focus of the teachings were directed towards
												actually learning how to code, with only a small focus on the quality and maintainability of the code.
												I wasn't confident in the quality of the code for my school projects. At 7D Surgial, I was able to get
												a sense of when my code can be improved thanks to feedback I got from my pull requests. My mentor had
												complimented me on my ability to incorporate past feedback into my future work.
												I feel that I've now become more sensitive about having clean and maintainable code than I was when I first started.
