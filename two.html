            <p>
                When you're out shopping for pots and pans, you might be overwhelmed with all the different types of
                materials they can be made of, and you might ask yourself: Which one is the best? This article serves to
                help you make that decision by breaking them down and giving you the pros and cons of each.

            <h2>Non-Stick</h2>
            <img src="images/two/nonstick.jpg" height="300">
            <p>
                Non-stick pans generally have a dark grey colour and are coated with a synthetic material called Teflon.
                Teflon helps create a non-stick, waterproof, and non-corrosive surface, which is ideal for cooking.
                These pans are great for delicate foods that may be prone to sticking, such as eggs.

                <br><br>

                Many people are concerned about risks to their health regarding Teflon. Before 2016, Teflon was being
                manufactured with a chemical called perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). This chemical poses a risk for health
                conditions like kidney and liver disease. However, in 2016, Canada banned the use of PFOA in Teflon
                manufacturing, and non-stick pans have since been PFOA-free. It is now generally believed that Teflon is
                safe to ingest if it somehow flakes off into the food.

                <br><br>

                One downside of non-stick pans is that the Teflon coating breaks down at high temperatures (500F or
                260C), so it isn't recommended to place these pans inside an oven. The pan generally shouldn't be
                reaching these temperatures in regular stove-top cooking though, so it's not too much of a concern so
                long as you aren't heating an empty pan without oil. Another downside is that metal utensils and scratch
                the Teflon coating, so it is generally advised to use softer materials such as silicon and wood. That
                being said, the coating eventually wears down through natural use, so it has a shorter lifespan compared
                to other types of pans.

            <h2>Stainless Steel</h2>
            <img src="images/two/stainlesssteel.jpg" height="300">
            <p>
                Stainless steel pans have light-grey, metallic sheen. They generally aren't coated with any kind of
                material, which allows you to use metal utensils in them without worrying about scratching anything off
                and into your food. These pans have a thinner profile, which allows them to adapt to changing
                temperatures quickly, unlike other pans that retain more heat like cast iron. This allows you to have
                more control of the temperature and respond more quickly to situations like your food burning. It is
                great for browning/caramelizing ingredients, helping to create a richer flavor. One downside of these
                pans is they can be more prone to sticking as they don't have any type of non-stick coating.

            <h2>Cast-Iron</h2>
            <img src="images/two/castiron.jpg" height="300">
            <p>
                Cast-iron pans have a dark grey colour and are noticeably heavier than other types of pans. The main
                benefit of these pans is their ability to retain heat, even after removing the heat source. This makes
                them particularly useful for searing things like meat or cooking lots of food at once without losing all
                the heat from putting them into the pan.

                <br><br>

                One of the downsides of cast iron is its weight. The heftiness of the pan makes it hard to toss food by
                flicking the pan. Another downside is it can't be used for recipes that require quick changes in
                temperature. While the pan is very good for retaining heat, it takes a long time to change the heat of
                the pan. This makes it harder to heat up or cool down the pan quickly. Finally, cast-iron pans require
                more maintenance than other pans as they need to be seasoned regularly in order to maintain their
                natural non-stick coating.
            </p>

            <h2>So, which one should I choose?</h2>
            <p>
                There is no right answer to this question. It all depends on the kind if food you plan to cook, and the
                techniques used. All of these materials are great in their own way, and each have their advantages and
                disadvantages. Overall, you probably should get at least more than one pan type so you can switch it up
                depending on what you're cooking.
